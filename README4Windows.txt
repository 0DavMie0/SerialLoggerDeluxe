Antivirus notes
===============

It is not unusual that you get problems with Windows' Defender or your Antivirus Software. BUT YOUR SOFTWARE IS NOT INFECTED! The reason is that I wrapped Java's JAR into an EXE file for convenience. This confuses a lot of antivirus apps because some viruses use a similar method to hide themselves from the user.

If you cannot solve this issue, use the FatJar distribution, also available at https://github.com/haniibrahim/SerialLogger/releases.
